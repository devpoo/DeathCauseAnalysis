# DeathCauseAnalysis
Data used for the assignment shows distribution of leading death causes in California from the years 1999 to 2013. I have made an attempt to find insights from the data to understand the distribution based various factors like causes, number of deaths its distribution over year and zip code. I have also tried to see how the trend of death causes has been over years and for different years. IBM Bluemix Apache spark service was used to answer these questions. I have listed the questions and answers answered in the report. Data Sources: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/leading-causes-of-death-by-zip-code-1999-2013
